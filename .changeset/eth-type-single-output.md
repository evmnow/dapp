'@evmnow/contract-reader': patch

Apply semantic type formatting to single-output function results. Previously, a read function returning a single value (e.g. `balanceOf`) ignored the `eth` / `percentage` / `basis-points` / `timestamp` types from metadata and rendered the raw value. Multi-output results were already handled correctly.
